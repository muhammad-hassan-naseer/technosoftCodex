          Joining the Arbisoft team is the beginning of a new journey. New hires
          are matched with a skilled and competent mentor, who will help you
          grow not just as an engineer but as a professional–someone with the
          talent and experience. Your mentor will help you shape your career.
          You also get time to settle in and learn the roles, as new graduates
          go through an intense 3-month training program before being moved to a
          live project, so you can begin to challenge yourself and grow as soon
          as you join without the fear of failure.
