          <b>When you target</b> important keywords correctly, you'll have
          better placement in results pages. When you find a specific keyword
          that is important to your business and your industry, you want to
          target it with your content, your meta tags, your alt tags, and your
          URL. That means you include that keyword in these important places so
          that you have the best chance of ranking for it when someone searches
          the term within Google.

        <li className="bg-blue p-2 rounded">
          <b>When you rank </b>highly for an important keyword, you'll get more
          site traffic. Studies show that the first position on results pages
          gets roughly 33% of clicks, while the second position receives around
          15%, with decreasing numbers from there. The top position truly is a
          prized location in search, and if you can get there, you’re going to
          see an increase in site traffic.
        </li>
        <li className="bg-blue p-2 rounded">
          <b>When you boost</b> site traffic, you'll see an increase in
          conversions. When more people visit your site because of your high
          rankings in search results, it means that you’ll also earn more
          conversions. If your page ranks in the first position of organic SEO
          results, it’s there for a reason —you’ve created a page, like a blog
          post, that is informative, high-quality, and provides everything that
          a user is looking for when they search for the targeted keyword. When
          people click on your page, since it’s so high quality, they’ll be more
          apt to spend time on your site, and there’s a higher possibility that
          they will purchase your products or services.
        </li>
        <li className="bg-blue p-2 rounded">
          <b>Increased conversions pave </b>the way for a growing business. When
          your conversions increase, it means your SEO campaign is successfully
          driving results, like by ranking in high-value search results, and
          that your business is thriving. The more thriving your business does,
          the more potential it has to grow.
